<p>The purpose of the lab is to give students an idea of the structure of a protein and how CD spectroscopy technique is useful to detect the characteristics of secondary structures of proteins. By performing the experiment a student will</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>understand the level of complexity of protein structure.</li>
<li>observe CD spectrum of different secondary structures of the protein.</li>
<li>have an idea about the importance of the N2 purging during measuring the CD spectrometer.</li>
