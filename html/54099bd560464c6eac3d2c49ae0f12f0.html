<p>The purpose of this lab is to make students familiar with the concept of protein aggregation. In the unfolded state a protein undergo aggregation. And CD spectroscopic methods provides us a nice way to determine that. By doing this experiment user will be able to,</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand how at unfolded state a protein undergoes aggregation.</li>
<li>Understand how CD spectroscopic methods are useful to determine aggregation effect.</li>
<li>Experience how environmental conditions control the aggregation effect.</li>
<li>Understand how comparative study of Dynode voltage helps to determine whether aggregation has taken place or not.</li>
