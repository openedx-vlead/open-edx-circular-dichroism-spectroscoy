<p>We have already learned from Experiment 1, how chiral molecules are optically active and how chiral substances can be characterized on the basis of their specific rotation [&alpha;]. You will have noticed that in that experiment we have used a sodium lamp with a wavelength of 589 nm as the light source, and may be wondering why the wave length of light source needed to be specified.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well, as has been explained in the following video using sucrose solution as an example, the specific rotation [&alpha;] for a given substance, and hence the molar rotation [&phi;], varies as a function of the wavelength (&lambda;) of the light source.This variation in the optical rotation ([&alpha;] or [&phi;] ) of a substance, with the variation in the wavelength (&lambda;) of light, is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_rotatory_dispersion" target="_blank">optical rotatory dispersion (ORD)</a>.</p>

<p>When a plane polarised wave passes through an optically active medium some times its<em> state of polarisation</em> also gets affected along with its <em>plane of polarisation</em> and it comes out from the medium as an elliptically polarised light. This phenomena is known as <em>Circular Dichroism</em>.</p>
