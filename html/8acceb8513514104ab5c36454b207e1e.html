<p>The purpose of this lab is to make students familiar with the concept that structure of a protein is highly dependent on the chemical environmental. By performing this experiment a student will also get familiar with the use of CD spectroscopy method to study the effect of chemical denaturant on protein structure. By doing this experiment a student will be able to,</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the student understand how a chemical environment denatures a protein.</li>
<li>Have an idea of the effect of different types of chemicals on the protein structure.</li>
<li>Have an idea of the effect of different concentrations of chemical environment on the protein structure.</li>
<li>Understand how CD spectroscopy can be used to study unfolding of proteins.</li>
<li>Observe transition between folded and unfolded state.</li>
<li>Determine the critical concentration of transition from folded to unfolded structure using CD spectra at different concentrations.</li>
