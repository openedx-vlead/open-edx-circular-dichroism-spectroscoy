<p>The purpose of this lab is to make students familiar with different types of ORD spectra obtained from different chiral substances. By doing this experiment user will be able to,</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>Develop an understanding about assigning R and S configuration to chiral structures.</li>
<li>Relate plain ORD curves and their sign with absolute configuration of sample.</li>
<li>Understand why anomalous ORD or Cotton effect is observed.</li>
