<p>In Experiment 3 we have seen variation in ORD spectra for different chiral molecules. In this experiment we will observe variation of CD spectra for chiral molecules with chromophores. We will aslo try to understand the relation between anomalous ORD spectra and CD spectra.</p>
<p>A CD spectra can be used as an identifying signature of chiral molecules where chromophore is present. For large chiral molecules like protein CD spectroscopy is used as a primary tool for structural characterization.</p>
