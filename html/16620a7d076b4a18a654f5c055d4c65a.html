<p>Purpose of this lab is to give students an idea of how CD spectrum of a protein sample is deconvoluted and how information about secondary structure of the protein sample can be obtained from it. By doing this lab an user will be able to understand, </p>
<ol>
<li>Different techniques of deconvolution of CD spectrum of a protein sample.</li>
<li>How to get information about secondary structures of a protein from its CD spectra.</li>
<li>How to classify a protein sample in terms of its secondary structure elements.</li>
