<p>The purpose of this lab is to make students familiar with the concept that structure of a protein is highly dependent on the environmental temperature and use of CD spectroscopy method to study the effect of temperature on protein structure. By doing this experiment user will be able to,</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the student understand how temperature causes unfolding of a protein.</li>
<li>Understand how CD spectroscopy can be used to study unfolding.</li>
<li>Observe transition between folded and unfolded state.</li>
<li>Determine the transition temperature using CD spectra at different temperatures.</li>
