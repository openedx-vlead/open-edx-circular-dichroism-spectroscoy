<p>2. Step-by-step Procedure</p>
<p>Step 1: Select any one of the two samples. <br />Step 2: Follow the instructions given in the Experimental-setup page. <br />Step 3: Select the temperature range and step size of your interest. <br />Step 4: Go through the instructions and fill up the table by clicking at the 222nm. <br />Step 5: Observe the plot and find out the transition temperature. <br />Step 6: Click on the &ldquo;Measure Dy-node Voltage&rdquo;. <br />Step 7: Follow the instruction and fill up the table by clicking at the 222nm. <br />Step 8: Observe the change in Dy-node voltage. <br />Step 9: Click on &ldquo;Go to Analysis&rdquo; <br />Step 10: Submit your answers. You can verify them from redoing the experiment or going through the theory. <br />Step 11: Once you have studied both the samples you may compare them by clicking &ldquo;COMPARE&rdquo;.</p>
